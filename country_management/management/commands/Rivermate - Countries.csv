Settled life first appeared in the area 9,000 years ago, eventually developing into the Indus, Oxus, and Helmand civilizations of the 3rd millennium BCE. Indo-Aryans migrated to Gandhara through the Bactria-Margiana area, followed by the rise of the Iron Age Yaz I culture, which has been linked to the culture depicted in the Avesta, Zoroastrianism's ancient religious texts. In the 6th century BCE, the city, then known as ""Ariana,"" fell to the Achaemenid Persians, who invaded the areas to their east as far as the Indus River. Invading the area in the 4th century BCE, Alexander the Great married Roxana in Bactria before embarking on a campaign in the Kabul Valley, where he encountered opposition from the Aspasioi and Assakan tribes. The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom became the Hellenistic world's easternmost point. Buddhism and Hinduism flourished in the area for centuries after the Mauryan Indians conquered it. The Kushan emperor Kanishka, who ruled from his twin capitals of Kapisi and Puruapura, was instrumental in Mahayana Buddhism's expansion to China and Central Asia. The Kidarites, Hephthalites, Alkhons, Nezaks, Zunbils, and Turk Shahis are among the Buddhist dynasties that originated in this area. The Saffarid, Samanid, Ghaznavid, and Ghurid dynasties introduced Islam to Sassanian-held Herat and Zaranj in the mid-7th century, and the Saffarid, Samanid, Ghaznavid, and Ghurid dynasties achieved complete Islamization between the 9th and 12th centuries. The Khwarazmian, Khalji, Timurid, Lodi, Sur, Mughal, and Safavid empires later dominated parts of the area. The Hotak dynasty, whose founder Mirwais Hotak proclaimed southern Afghanistan independent in 1709, is responsible for the current state of Afghanistan's political history. Ahmad Shah Durrani established the Durrani Empire in 1747, with Kandahar as its capital. The Durrani capital was relocated to Kabul in 1776, while Peshawar was designated as the winter capital; the latter was captured by Sikhs in 1823. Afghanistan served as a buffer state in the ""Great Game"" between British India and the Russian Empire in the late 1800s.</p>",399,afghanistan,TRUE,TRUE

It is South America's second-largest nation after Brazil, the Americas' fourth-largest country, and the world's eighth-largest country. It shares the majority of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west and is additionally bounded to the north by Bolivia and Paraguay, to the northeast by Brazil, to the east by Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Drake Passage. Argentina is a federal-state split into twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires, which serves as the federal capital and biggest metropolis in the country.

In pre-Columbian times, the Inca Empire spread to the northwest of the nation. The country's origins may be traced back to the 16th-century Spanish colonization of the area. Argentina came to prominence as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, a Spanish foreign viceroyalty established in 1776. The proclamation of independence and the subsequent battle for independence (1810–1818) were followed by a prolonged civil war that lasted until 1861, resulting in the country's reformation as a federation. Following that, the country enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, primarily Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; today, more than 60% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry, and Argentine culture has strong ties to Italian culture.</p><p id="""">Argentina became the seventh-wealthiest country in the world by the early twentieth century, thanks to an almost unprecedented surge in income.

Argentina plunged into political instability and economic deterioration after the Great Depression of the 1930s, pushing it back into underdevelopment, although being among the fifteen wealthiest nations for many decades. After President Juan Perón died in 1974, his wife and vice president, Isabel Perón, succeeded to the presidency until being deposed in 1976. The succeeding military junta, backed by the US, imprisoned and killed thousands of political dissidents, activists, and communists during the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that lasted until Raúl Alfonsín was elected president in 1983.</p><p id="""">Argentina is a regional power with a long history as a medium power in international affairs.

The kingdom collapsed in 1045 as a result of conflicts against the Byzantines, and Armenia was shortly conquered by the Seljuk Turks.

The Armenian genocide occurred during World War I, when 1.5 million Armenians residing in their ancestral territories in the Ottoman Empire were methodically slaughtered. Following the Russian Revolution in 1918, all non-Russian nations proclaimed their independence, resulting in the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia. The state was absorbed into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic by 1920, and it became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922. Transcaucasia was dissolved in 1936, converting its component nations, notably the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into complete Union republics.

Following the breakup of the Empire in 1806, Austria founded its own empire, which grew to become a major power and the dominating member of the German Confederation.

The British outlawed the slave trade in 1807, while slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. As a result, the Bahamas became a safe refuge for liberated African slaves. The Royal Navy relocated Africans freed from illegal slave ships on the islands, while some North American slaves and Seminoles fled to the Bahamas from Florida.

The nation is dominated by Bengali Muslims. As the home of the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela, ancient Bengal was an important cultural hub in the Indian subcontinent. The final pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal were the Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra, and Deva kingdoms. Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and attacked Tibet in 1204, beginning the Muslim invasion of Bengal. In the 14th century, three city-states arose as part of the Delhi Sultanate, with Sonargaon ruling over most of eastern Bengal. Sufi missionary leaders such as Sultan Balkhi, Shah Jalal, and Shah Makhdum Rupos contributed to the expansion of Muslim power. The Bengal Sultanate became an autonomous, unitary state. Eastern Bengal thrived during Mughal control as a melting pot of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent, attracting merchants from all over the globe. Under the Nawabs of Bengal in the 18th century, Mughal Bengal grew more forceful and autonomous. The defection of Mir Jafar in 1757 culminated in Nawab Siraj-ud-loss Daulah's to the British East India Company and ultimate British control over South Asia. The Bengal Presidency expanded to become British India's biggest administrative subdivision. The formation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 established a pattern for the establishment of Bangladesh. The first Prime Minister of Bengal endorsed the Lahore Resolution with the goal of establishing a state in eastern South Asia in 1940. Prior to Bengal's division, the Prime Minister suggested a Bengali independent state. Bangladesh's current geographical limit was set by a referendum and the proclamation of the Radcliffe Line.</p><p id="""">East Bengal became the Dominion of Pakistan's most populated province in 1947. East Pakistan was renamed, and Dhaka became the country's legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the East Bengali parliamentary election in 1954, the Pakistani coup d'état in 1958, the Six Point Movement in 1966, and the Pakistani general election in 1970 all contributed to the emergence of Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy activities in East Pakistan. The unwillingness of the Pakistani military junta to hand over power to the Awami League, led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, in which the Mukti Bahini, assisted by India, conducted a successful armed revolution. During the fight, there was a genocide in Bangladesh in 1971, as well as a slaughter of pro-independence Bengali civilians, including intellectuals. In 1972, Bangladesh became the first legally secular state in South Asia. In 1988, Islam was named the official religion. The Bangladesh Supreme Court upheld secular elements in the country's constitution in 2010.</p><p id="""">Bangladesh is a Westminster-style unitary parliamentary constitutional republic.

It has the third-largest military in South Asia, behind India and Pakistan, and has contributed significantly to UN peacekeeping missions. Bangladesh, a middle power in the Indo-Pacific, is a developing economy rated 41st in the world by nominal GDP and 29th by PPP.

Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, many republics developed contending for legitimacy during the Civil War, eventually culminating in the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, which became a founding component republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. Belarus lost about half of its territory to Poland during the Polish-Soviet War. Much of Belarus's contemporary boundaries were established in 1939 when certain regions of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland and were formalized after World War II. During WWII, military activities destroyed Belarus, causing the country to lose a quarter of its people and half of its economic resources. In the postwar years, the republic was rebuilt.

Brussels is the capital and biggest city; other notable cities include Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège, Bruges, Namur, and Leuven.</p><p id="""">Belgium is a sovereign state with a parliamentary system and a federal constitutional monarchy. Its institutional framework is complicated, with regional and language divisions. The country is split into three largely autonomous regions: the Flemish Region (Flanders) in the north, the Walloon Region (Wallonia) in the south, and the Brussels-Capital Region in the center.

Although French is the prevalent language in the Brussels-Capital Region, the region is legally multilingual in both French and Dutch. Belgium's linguistic variety and concomitant political disputes are mirrored in its complicated governance structure, which is comprised of six separate administrations.</p><p id="""">The nation as it exists now was formed during the Belgian Revolution of 1830 when it seceded from the Netherlands, which had only existed since 1815. The name selected for the new state is taken from the Latin term Belgium, which was used to denote a neighboring territory in Julius Caesar's ""Gallic Wars"" about 55 BCE. Belgium is part of the Low Countries, which was historically a wider territory than the Benelux group of nations since it covered sections of northern France. Since the Middle Ages, the area's center position near multiple important rivers has meant that it has been reasonably rich, financially and politically tied to its larger neighbors. Belgium has also served as a battlefield for European nations, gaining the title ""Battlefield of Europe,"" a reputation that was bolstered in the twentieth century by both world wars.</p><p id="""">Belgium took part in the Industrial Revolution and controlled a number of African colonies throughout the twentieth century. The Congo Free State, which was privately controlled by King Leopold II of Belgium from 1885 and 1908, was marked by extensive atrocities and a population fall of millions, prompting Belgium to take over the area as a colony.</p><p id="""">The second half of the twentieth century saw increased tensions between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking populations, fueled by linguistic and cultural disparities, as well as the uneven economic growth of Flanders and Wallonia. This ongoing rivalry has resulted in a series of far-reaching changes, culminating in a move from a unitary to a federal setup between 1970 and 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism, particularly among the Flemish; controversial language laws exist, such as municipalities with language facilities; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months, a world record, following the June 2010 federal election. Wallonia's unemployment rate is more than twice that of Flanders, which surged following WWII.</p><p id="""">Belgium is one of the six founding nations of the European Union, and its city, Brussels, serves as the official headquarters of the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Council, as well as one of the two seats of the European Parliament (the other being Strasbourg).

Its landscape ranges from the Andes highlands in the west to the Eastern Lowlands in the Amazon basin. Brazil borders it on the north and east, Paraguay on the southeast, Argentina on the south, Chile on the southwest, and Peru on the northwest. The Andean mountain range encompasses one-third of the nation. Bolivia is the fifth largest country in South America, after Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia (and, along with Paraguay, one of the only two landlocked countries in the Americas), the world's 27th largest, the largest landlocked country in the Southern Hemisphere, and the world's seventh-largest landlocked country, after Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Ethiopia.</p><p id="""">The country's estimated 11 million inhabitants are multiethnic, including Amerindians, Mestizos, Europeans, Asians, and Africans among them.

Spain's empire was formed in significant part on the silver produced from Bolivia's mines. Following the initial demand for independence in 1809, the Republic of Simón Bolvar was established after 16 years of struggle. Bolivia lost sovereignty of various peripheral lands to neighboring nations throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, notably the takeover of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia was politically stable until 1971 when Hugo Banzer staged a CIA-backed coup that replaced Juan José Torres' socialist government with a military dictatorship commanded by Banzer. Banzer's dictatorship repressed left-wing and socialist opposition, as well as various kinds of protest, culminating in the torture and murder of many Bolivian civilians. Banzer was deposed in 1978 and eventually returned as Bolivia's freely elected president from 1997 to 2001.

The territory was a battlefield for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts, and Macedonians from the sixth to third centuries BC; stability arrived with the Roman Empire's conquest of the province in AD 45. Tribal assaults in the area continued when the Roman state disintegrated. These lands were colonized by the early Slavs about the 6th century. In the late 7th century, the Bulgars commanded by Asparuh of Bulgaria launched an offensive from the regions of (Old Great) Bulgaria and permanently conquered the Balkans. They formed (Danubian) Bulgaria, which was successful in a pact with the Eastern Roman Empire in AD 681. It governed the majority of the Balkans and had a huge impact on Slavic civilizations by establishing the Cyrillic alphabet. The First Bulgarian Empire existed until the early 11th century when it was captured and destroyed by Byzantine emperor Basil II. In 1185, a victorious Bulgarian insurrection formed the Second Bulgarian Empire, which peaked under Ivan Asen II (1218–1241). The empire dissolved in 1396, after multiple arduous battles and feudal struggle, and came under Ottoman authority for over five centuries.</p><p id="""">The third and present Bulgarian state was formed as a consequence of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the boundaries of the new country, fueling irredentist sentiments that led to many clashes with its neighbors and alliances with Germany in both world wars. Bulgaria joined the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc in 1946 and became a socialist state. Following the upheavals of 1989, the governing Communist Party relinquished its monopoly on power and permitted multiparty elections. Bulgaria thereafter became a democracy with a market-based economy.

In the nineteenth century, Fulani troops built the Adamawa Emirate in the north, while numerous ethnic groups in the west and northwest established strong chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony known as Kamerun in 1884. Following World War I, it was partitioned into League of Nations mandates for France and the United Kingdom. The political group Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) desired independence but was proscribed by France in the 1950s, sparking a national liberation insurrection waged between French and UPC militant troops until early 1971. The French-administered region of Cameroon gained independence in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon, led by President Ahmadou Ahidjo. In 1961, it merged with the southern half of British Cameroons to become the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972, the federation was disbanded. In 1972, the nation was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon, and in 1984, it was renamed the Republic of Cameroon. The current president, Paul Biya, has governed the country since 1982, after Ahidjo's resignation; he previously served as prime minister from 1975 to 1982. Cameroon is ruled by a presidential unitary republic.</p><p id="""">Cameroon's official languages are French and English, which are also the official languages of former French Cameroons and British Cameroons.

The surrender and expulsion of Japanese troops from China in 1945 created a power vacuum in the nation, resulting in fresh conflict between the CCP and the Kuomintang. The civil war concluded in 1949 with the split of Chinese territory; the CCP created the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while the ROC government fled to Taiwan.

His colonial military corps, the Force Publique, compelled the local populace to manufacture rubber during the Free State.

During the Congo Crisis, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, afterwards renamed Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, took control in a coup and renamed the nation Zaire in 1971. His Popular Movement of the Revolution was the only legal party in the nation, and it was ruled as a totalitarian one-party state. Mobutu's regime started to deteriorate by the early 1990s.

Eventually, nine African nations and roughly twenty armed organizations got engaged in the conflict, which killed 5.4 million people. The nation was destroyed by the two wars. Kabila was assassinated on January 16, 2001, by one of his bodyguards, and was succeeded eight days later by his son Joseph, under whom human rights in the country remained poor, with frequent abuses such as forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment, and restrictions on civil liberties, according to non-governmental organizations.

This period's archaeological remnants include the well-preserved Neolithic settlement of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the world's earliest water wells. In the second millennium BC, Mycenaean Greeks inhabited Cyprus in two waves. As a strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean, it was afterward held by various important nations, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Persians, from whom Alexander the Great captured the island in 333 BC. Following Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empires, Arab caliphates for a brief time, the French Lusignan dynasty, and the Venetians, Ottoman dominance lasted almost three centuries, from 1571 to 1878. (de jure until 1914).</p><p id="""">Cyprus was administered by the United Kingdom under the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and officially acquired by the United Kingdom in 1914. The island's future became a source of contention between the island's two most populous ethnic groups, Greek Cypriots (77 percent of the population in 1960) and Turkish Cypriots (18 percent). The Greek Cypriot people advocated enosis, or unification with Greece, beginning in the nineteenth century and becoming a Greek national policy in the 1950s. The Turkish Cypriot population first supported the British administration, then wanted annexation of the island to Turkey, and in the 1950s, allied with Turkey, launched a Taksim strategy, partitioning Cyprus and establishing a Turkish republic in the north. Cyprus gained independence in 1960 as a result of nationalist unrest in the 1950s. The 1963–64 crisis resulted in greater intercommunal violence between the two communities, the displacement of almost 25,000 Turkish Cypriots into enclaves, and the termination of Turkish Cypriot participation in the republic. In an attempt for enosis, Greek Cypriot nationalists and parts of the Greek military junta tried a coup on July 15, 1974. This action triggered the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, resulting in the acquisition of the current area of Northern Cyprus and the displacement of about 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. In 1983, a distinct Turkish Cypriot state was founded in the north by unilateral proclamation; the action was severely criticized by the international community, with only Turkey recognizing the new state. These events, as well as the resultant political position, are still a source of contention.</p><p id="""">With the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which remain under the administration of the UK by the London and Zürich Agreements, the Republic of Cyprus enjoys de jure sovereignty over the whole island, including its territorial seas and exclusive economic zone. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto divided into two parts: the area under the Republic's effective control, which is located in the south and west and accounts for approximately 59 percent of the island's area, and the north, which is administered by the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and accounts for approximately 36 percent of the island's area. The UN buffer zone covers about 4% of the island's surface area. The international world regards the northern portion of the island as Republic of Cyprus territory held by Turkish soldiers. Since Cyprus became a member of the European Union, the occupation has been considered unlawful under international law and amounts to the illegal occupation of EU territory.</p><p id="""">Cyprus is a popular Mediterranean vacation destination.

It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola, along with Saint Martin, one of only two Caribbean islands shared by two sovereign governments. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest country in the Antilles by land (after Cuba), and the third-largest by population, with around 10.8 million inhabitants (2020 estimate), 3.3 million of whom reside in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.

They had built a sophisticated agricultural and hunting community and were on their way to establishing an organized civilization. The Tanos was also found in Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas. Christopher Columbus, a Genoese mariner, explored and claimed the island for Castile on his first expedition in 1492. Santo Domingo became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, as well as the first seat of Spanish colonial administration in the New World. Spain accepted French control over the western portion of the island in 1697, and Haiti became an independent state in 1804.</p><p id="""">In November 1821, the Dominicans proclaimed independence from Spain after more than 300 years of domination. The leader of the independence movement, José Nez de Cáceres, hoped to merge the Dominican nation with Gran Colombia, but the newly independent Dominicans were annexed by Haiti in February 1822. Independence occurred 22 years later, in 1844 when the Dominican War of Independence was won. The Dominican Republic underwent largely internal conflicts (funded by loans from European merchants), multiple unsuccessful invasions by its neighbor, Haiti, and a temporary restoration to Spanish colonial status until ultimately removing the Spanish during the Dominican War of Restoration of 1863–1865. Three presidents were murdered during this time period: José Antonio Salcedo in 1864, Ulises Heureaux in 1899, and Ramón Cáceres in 1911.</p><p id="""">The United States invaded the Dominican Republic (1916–1924) in response to concerns of international debt default; a subsequent tranquil and successful six-year era under Horacio Vásquez followed.

The country's last civil war, in 1965, was halted by US military involvement and was followed by the authoritarian leadership of Joaquin Balaguer (1966–1978 and 1986–1996). Since 1978, the Dominican Republic has progressed toward representative democracy, with Leonel Fernández serving as President for the majority of the period since 1996. Danilo Medina replaced Fernández in 2012, defeating ex-President Hipólito Meja with 51 percent of the vote. In the 2020 presidential election, he was replaced by Luis Abinader.</p><p id="""">According to the US State Department and the World Bank, the Dominican Republic has the biggest economy in the Caribbean and Central America area, and is the seventh-largest in Latin America.

GDP growth rates in 2014 and 2015 were the highest in the Western Hemisphere, at 7.3 and 7.0 percent, respectively. The Dominican economy increased 7.4 percent in the first half of 2016, maintaining its history of high economic expansion. Construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining have all contributed to recent prosperity. The nation is home to the world's third-biggest gold mine, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Because of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of remittances, private spending has been solid.

The Viceroyalty of Mexico, on the other hand, had little to no impact on the day-to-day affairs of the isthmus, which was colonized in 1524. The Spanish designated the region to be the Captaincy General of Guatemala in 1609, which comprised the territory that would become El Salvador until its independence from Spain in 1821. It was forced into the First Mexican Empire until seceding and joining the Federal Republic of Central America in 1823.

This was followed by a surge in the usage of the indigo plant (ail in Spanish) in the nineteenth century, mostly for use as a dye. Following that, the emphasis turned to coffee, which accounted for 90 percent of export revenues by the early twentieth century. El Salvador has now lessened its reliance on coffee and begun diversifying its economy by growing the industrial sector and opening up trade and financial linkages.

Following a vote by the UN General Assembly in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself via a native Eritrean parliament, but for foreign affairs and defense, it would enter into a ten-year federal relationship with Ethiopia. However, in 1962, the Ethiopian government dissolved the Eritrean parliament and legally conquered Eritrea.

Ono-i-Lau is the most remote island group. The two biggest islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are home to about 87 percent of the total population of 883,483. Approximately three-quarters of Fijians reside on Viti Levu's coastlines, either in Suva, the capital city, or in smaller urban areas such as Nadi, where tourism is the main local economy, or in Lautoka, where the sugar-cane industry is prominent.

Fiji was a Crown colony until 1970 when it achieved independence and became the Dominion of Fiji. Following a series of coups, the military administration that had acquired control proclaimed it a republic in 1987. Commodore Frank Bainimarama took control in a coup in 2006. The Fijian High Court found in 2009 that the military leadership was unconstitutional. At that moment, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who had been designated as the nominal head of state by the military, legally repealed the 1997 Constitution and re-installed Bainimarama as temporary prime minister. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau replaced Iloilo as president later that year. After years of delay, a democratic election was held on September 17, 2014.

As a consequence of the Finnish War, Finland became part of the Russian Empire in 1809 as the independent Grand Duchy of Finland, during which time Finnish art thrived and the concept of independence gained traction. Finland became the first European country to provide universal suffrage in 1906, and the first in the world to allow all adult citizens to run for public office. The last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, attempted to russify Finland and remove its political autonomy, but following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland proclaimed independence from Russia.

In 51 BC, Rome acquired the region, resulting in a unique Gallo-Roman civilization that created the groundwork for the French language. The Germanic Franks established the Kingdom of Francia, which became the Carolingian Empire's core. The empire was partitioned by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. France was a strong but largely decentralized feudal state in the High Middle Ages. Philip II effectively consolidated royal authority and overcame his competitors in order to treble the extent of the crown territories; by the conclusion of his reign, France had emerged as Europe's most powerful kingdom. From the mid-14th through the mid-15th centuries, France was engulfed in a series of dynastic battles including England, known collectively as the Hundred Years' War, and as a consequence, a unique French identity formed. The French Renaissance witnessed the flourishing of art and culture, the struggle with the House of Habsburg, and the formation of a worldwide colonial empire that would become the world's second-largest by the twentieth century. Religious civil conflicts between Catholics and Huguenots dominated the second half of the 16th century, severely weakening the realm. Following the Thirty Years' War, France re-emerged as Europe's dominating power in the 17th century under Louis XIV. Inadequate economic strategies, inequitable taxation, and recurrent battles (particularly a loss in the Seven Years' War and expensive participation in the American War of Independence) placed the kingdom in a dangerous economic position by the end of the 18th century. This sparked the French Revolution of 1789, which toppled the Ancien Régime and resulted in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which still embodies the nation's beliefs today.</p><p id="""">Napoleon Bonaparte led France to its political and military apex in the early nineteenth century, subjugating most of continental Europe and creating the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars affected European and global history. The fall of the empire marked the beginning of a period of relative decline for France, which saw a chaotic succession of rulers until the establishment of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Following decades witnessed the Belle Époque, an era of optimism, artistic and scientific growth, and economic success. France was a key participant in World War I, emerging victorious at a considerable human and economic cost. It was one of the Allied powers during World War II, but it was quickly seized by the Axis in 1940. Following independence in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was created, only to be disbanded during the Algerian War. Charles de Gaulle established the present Fifth Republic in 1958.

The Greeks were organized into different separate city-states known as poleis (plural polis) that covered the Mediterranean and the Black Sea beginning in the seventh century BC. In the fourth century BC, Philip II of Macedon unified much of modern-day Greece, and his son Alexander the Great quickly conquered much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. The Hellenistic era was the pinnacle of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was captured by Rome in the second century BC, becoming a component of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire, which was largely Greek culturally and linguistically. The Greek Orthodox Church, which began in the first century AD, helped form contemporary Greek identity and spread Greek customs across the Orthodox world.

Greenland is the world's biggest island and one of the three component nations that comprise the Kingdom of Denmark, together with Denmark and the Faroe Islands; all of these countries' residents are Danish nationals. Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqqata, Qeqertalik, and Avannaata are the five municipalities of Greenland. The unorganized Northeast Greenland National Park is located in the island's northeast. Thule Air Base, an enclave inside Avannaata municipality maintained by the United States Space Force, is also unincorporated. Nuuk is the capital of Greenland.</p><p id="""">Though geographically part of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally tied with Europe (particularly the colonial powers Norway and Denmark) for over a century, starting in 986. The bulk of its inhabitants are Inuit, whose ancestors moved from Alaska via Northern Canada before settling over the island in the 13th century.</p><p id="""">The population is now mostly centered on the southwest shore, with the remainder of the island being lightly inhabited. The only permanent ice sheet outside of Antarctica covers three-quarters of Greenland. It is the world's least densely inhabited territory, with a population of 56,081 (2020). Nuuk, the capital and biggest city, is home to around one-third of the population; Sisimiut, 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Nuuk, is the second-largest city in terms of population. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry connects the different towns and communities in western Greenland, which has been inhabited at various times over the previous 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forefathers moved there from what is now Canada. Beginning in the 10th century, Norsemen populated the desolate southern region of Greenland, having already established Iceland. These Norsemen subsequently sailed sail from Greenland and Iceland, with Leif Erikson being the first known European to reach North America over 500 years before Columbus. The Inuit came in the 13th century. Despite being under the ongoing influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland did not become legally subject to the Norwegian crown until 1261. The Norse colonies vanished in the late 15th century when Norway was devastated by the Black Death. Beginning in 1499, shortly after their extinction, the Portuguese temporarily investigated and seized the island, dubbing it Terra do Lavrador (later applied to Labrador in Canada).</p><p id="""">Danish explorers returned to Greenland in the early 17th century. Denmark–Norway asserted control over the island in order to enhance trade and power. Norway lost control over Greenland when the union was dissolved in 1814 due to its poor state. Greenland became Danish in 1814 and was completely absorbed into the Danish state under the Danish Constitution in 1953. Greenlanders became Danish citizens after the adoption of the Constitution in 1953. Greenland joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1961 after Denmark joined as a founding member in 1960, but its membership ended in 1973 when Denmark joined the European Communities. Greenland and Denmark joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. In a referendum in 1982, however, a majority of the public opted for Greenland to leave the EEC.

It shares the western three-eighths of the island with the Dominican Republic. To the southwest is the little Navassa Island, which is claimed by Haiti but is challenged as a United States territory administered by the federal government. Haiti is 27,750 km2 (10,714 sq mi) in size, the third biggest nation by area in the Caribbean, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million, making it the Caribbean's most populated country. Port-au-Prince is the capital.</p><p id="""">The indigenous Tano people, who originated in South America, first settled on the island. The first Europeans landed on December 5, 1492, during Christopher Columbus' first journey, which led him to assume he had discovered India or China. Later, Columbus established La Navidad, the first European outpost in the Americas, on what is now Haiti's northeastern shore. The island was claimed by Spain and renamed La Espaola, and it remained a part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century. However, due to conflicting claims and colonization by the French, the western section of the island was given to France in 1697 and renamed Saint-Domingue. French colonists created profitable sugarcane fields, which were labored on by large numbers of African slaves, making the colony one of the wealthiest in the world.</p><p id="""">During the French Revolution (1789–99), slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), headed by Toussaint Louverture, a former slave and the first black commander of the French Army.

All of Haiti's earliest leaders were former slaves, with the exception of Alexandre Pétion, the first President of the Republic. After a short period of division, President Jean-Pierre Boyer unified the nation and then sought to bring the whole island of Hispaniola under Haitian authority, sparking a lengthy series of battles that concluded in the 1870s when Haiti legally acknowledged the Dominican Republic's independence.</p><p id="""">Haiti's first century of independence was marked by political turmoil, diplomatic isolation, and the payment of a debilitating debt to France. From 1915 through 1934, the United States occupied the nation due to political instability and foreign economic influence. Following a series of brief presidencies, François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule that was continued by his son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, until 1986; the period was marked by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation.

Reykjavik, Iceland's capital and biggest city, is home to more than 65 percent of the country's population (together with its surrounding territories). Iceland is the only segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that rises above sea level, and its central volcanic plateau erupts almost every day. The interior is characterized by a plateau with sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, with several glacial rivers flowing to the sea via the lowlands. Despite its high latitude close beyond the Arctic Circle, Iceland boasts a mild climate due to the Gulf Stream.

Norwegians, and to a lesser degree other Scandinavians, came to Iceland in the following centuries, bringing with them thralls (slaves or serfs) of Gaelic ancestry.</p><p id="""">The island was ruled as an autonomous nation by the Althing, one of the world's oldest operating legislative assemblies. Iceland surrendered to Norwegian power in the 13th century after a period of civil war. The Kalmar Union, founded in 1397, brought together the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland therefore followed Norway's accession to the union, falling under Danish control upon Sweden's withdrawal from the union in 1523. In 1550, the Danish monarchy forcibly brought Lutheranism to Iceland.</p><p id="""">Following the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, Iceland's quest for independence took shape, culminating in 1918 with the foundation of the Kingdom of Iceland, which shared the current king of Denmark via a personal union. During the occupation of Denmark during WWII, Iceland decisively chose to become a republic in 1944, therefore breaking the last official links with Denmark. Despite the suspension of the Althing from 1799 to 1845, the island republic is recognized with preserving the world's oldest and longest-running parliament.</p><p id="""">Iceland depended heavily on subsistence fishing and agriculture until the twentieth century.

By 1200 BCE, an early version of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had spread into India from the northwest, becoming the language of the Rigveda and documenting the birth of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were displaced in the north and west. By 400 BCE, Hinduism had developed caste division and exclusion, while Buddhism and Jainism had evolved, establishing social hierarchies unrelated to heredity. The loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires located in the Ganges Basin arose from early political consolidations. Their age was characterized by a vast range of inventiveness, but also by the decreasing position of women and the adoption of untouchability into an organized system of religion.

Muslim troops from Central Asia invaded India's northern plains on a regular basis, ultimately creating the Delhi Sultanate and absorbing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. The Vijayanagara Empire established a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India in the 15th century. Sikhism evolved in the Punjab, opposing institutionalized religion. In 1526, the Mughal Empire brought two centuries of relative calm, leaving a legacy of dazzling architecture. The British East India Company gradually expanded its influence, transforming India into a colonial economy while simultaneously strengthening its sovereignty. The British Crown took over in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were gradually given, but technical advances were made, and notions about education, modernity, and public life took hold. A strong and prominent nationalist movement arose, known for peaceful resistance, and proved a crucial role at the end of British authority. The British Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign dominions in 1947, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid widespread death and migration.</p><p id="""">Since 1950, India has been a federated republic administered by a democratic parliamentary government.

In the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great defeated the Achaemenid Empire, which was thereafter split into various Hellenistic republics. In the third century BC, an Iranian insurrection formed the Parthian Empire, which was replaced in the third century AD by the Sassanid Empire, which remained a significant international power for the following four centuries. In the seventh century AD, Arab Muslims seized the empire, resulting in the Islamization of Iran. During the Islamic Golden Age, it became a significant center of Islamic culture and scholarship, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond. Before the Seljuk Turks and Mongols invaded the area, a succession of local Iranian Muslim dynasties arose over the following two centuries. The native Safavids re-established a united Iranian state and national identity in the 15th century and converted the country to Shia Islam. Iran regained its position as a major international power under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, however by the 19th century, a series of confrontations with the Russian Empire had resulted in considerable territorial losses. The Persian Constitutional Revolution occurred in the early twentieth century. Attempts to nationalize its fossil fuel supplies from Western firms ended in an Anglo-American revolution in 1953, resulting in a more authoritarian government under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and increasing Western political dominance.

Italy is the third-most populated member state of the European Union, with about 60 million people.</p><p id="""">Italy has traditionally been home to a diverse range of peoples and civilizations due to its pivotal geographic position in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean. Beginning with the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians established colonies mostly in insular Italy, Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy, and Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy, respectively, in addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name. In the eighth century BC, an Italic tribe known as the Latins established the Roman Kingdom, which later became a republic governed by the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic originally conquered and integrated its Italian peninsula neighbors before extending and conquering areas of Europe, North Africa, and Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman Empire had established itself as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin, as well as a major cultural, political, and religious center, ushering in the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature flourished.</p><p id="""">Despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Barbarian Invasions during the Early Middle Ages, by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, primarily in northern and central Italy, had become prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying greater democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partly due to a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese, and other foes. The Renaissance started in Italy and extended across Europe, rekindling interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art. Italian culture thrived, generating world-renowned thinkers, artists, and polymaths. Italian explorers explored new ways to the Far East and the New World throughout the Middle Ages, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nonetheless, the emergence of trade routes that avoided the Mediterranean substantially weakened Italy's economic and political influence. Centuries of foreign invasion and involvement, as well as competition and infighting among Italian city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th ages, left Italy politically fractured, and it was overrun and split throughout the centuries by many foreign European powers.</p><p id="""">Rising Italian nationalism and cries for independence from foreign influence ushered in an era of revolutionary political turmoil during the mid-nineteenth century. Following a war of independence, Italy was nearly totally united in 1861, forming the Kingdom of Italy after centuries of foreign dominance and political disunity. From the late 1800s through the early 1900s, Italy quickly industrialized, mostly in the north, and established a colonial empire, while the south remained largely destitute and excluded from industrialization, fostering a vast and powerful diaspora. Despite being one of the victorious allied nations in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic and social instability, which eventually led to the creation of the Italian fascist dictatorship in 1922. Fascist Italy's involvement in World War II on the Axis side and against the Allies resulted in military loss, economic catastrophe, and occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany and the collaborationist Italian Social Republic. Following the emergence of the Italian Resistance, the ensuing Italian Civil War, and Italy's liberation, the nation abolished its monarchy, formed a democratic Republic, had a protracted economic boom, and became a highly developed country.</p><p id="""">Italy has a developed economy.

Jamaica became a significant sugar exporter during British colonial authority, with a plantation economy based on African slaves and their descendants.

Political authority was controlled by a succession of military dictators (shogun) and feudal lords (daimyo) beginning in the 12th century and enforced by a class of warrior nobles (samurai). Following a century of civil conflict, Japan was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which pursued an isolationist foreign policy. A US navy drove Japan to open commerce to the West in 1854, leading to the collapse of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial rule in 1868. During the Meiji era, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-style constitution and embarked on an industrialization and modernization program. Japan invaded China in 1937 and joined World War II as an Axis power in 1941, amid a surge in militarism and foreign expansion. After defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombs, Japan surrendered in 1945 and was under Allied occupation for seven years, during which it established a new constitution and formed a military alliance with the United States.

Lan Xang was divided into three kingdoms during a period of internal conflict: Luang Phrabang, Vientiane, and Champasak.

It is bounded to the north and east by Syria and to the south by Israel, with Cyprus to the west across the Mediterranean Sea; its position at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has contributed to its rich past and formed a religiously diverse cultural identity. Lebanon has a population of around six million people and an area of 10,452 square kilometers (4,036 square miles), making it one of the world's smallest nations.

The Phoenicians, a maritime society that lasted for about 3000 years (c. 3200–539 BCE), lived in modern-day Lebanon. The Roman Empire seized the province in 64 BCE, and it ultimately became one of the empire's primary centers of Christianity. The Mount Lebanon range witnessed the birth of the Maronite Church, a monastic institution. The Maronites retained their faith and identity when the territory was conquered by the early Arab Muslims. However, a new religious sect known as the Druze later established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, resulting in a centuries-long religious division. The Maronites re-established communication with the Roman Catholic Church and emphasized their communion with Rome during the Crusades. In the early eighteenth century, the Maronite Catholics and the Druze established modern Lebanon via the ""Maronite-Druze dualism"" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.</p><p id="""">The Ottoman Empire seized Lebanon in the 16th century and ruled it for the following 400 years. During the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the five Ottoman provinces that comprise modern-day Lebanon were placed under the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon, under which the French-ruled precursor state of Greater Lebanon was founded. Following Nazi Germany's invasion and occupation of the French Third Republic during World War II, French control over the area diminished. Lebanon adopted a unique confessionalist style of government after obtaining independence from Free France in 1943, with particular governmental powers assigned to the state's main religious sects. Lebanon was very steady at first. This calm was short-lived and was eventually disrupted by the start of large-scale violence between different political and sectarian groups during the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). Lebanon was also subjected to overlapping foreign military occupations by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000 during this time period.

Between 1822 and the commencement of the American Civil War in 1861, more than 15,000 emancipated and free-born black people, as well as 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans, fled to Liberia to escape social and legal persecution in the United States. The immigrants gradually developed an ""Americo-Liberian"" identity, bringing their culture and history with them; the Liberian constitution and flag were fashioned after those of the United States, and the capital was named after ACS backer and United States President James Monroe. Liberia proclaimed independence on July 26, 1847, but the United States refused to acknowledge it until February 5, 1862. After the Liberians declared independence on January 3, 1848, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a rich, free-born African American from the United States state of Virginia who had moved to Liberia, was chosen as Liberia's first president.</p><p id="""">Liberia was the first African republic to declare independence, and it is the continent's first and oldest modern republic. It was one of the few African nations that kept its independence during the Scramble for Africa. During World War II, Liberia backed the United States' war effort against Germany, and as a result, the nation received significant American investment in infrastructure, which benefited its riches and growth. Liberia was a founder member of the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the Organization of African Unity, and President William Tubman pushed economic and political improvements that increased the country's wealth and worldwide image.</p><p id="""">The indigenous peoples they met, particularly those living in the more secluded interior, were not warmly received by the Americo-Liberian immigrants. The Kru and Grebo invaded colonial communities from their interior chiefdoms. Americo-Liberians encouraged religious groups to establish missions and schools to educate the indigenous people. Americo-Liberians created a tiny elite with disproportionate political influence; indigenous Africans were denied birthright citizenship in their own country until 1904.</p><p id="""">Political tensions from William R.

Despite massive unemployment, the Malawian government confronts hurdles in its attempts to grow and expand the economy, enhance education, healthcare, and environmental protection, and achieve financial independence. Malawi has implemented many initiatives to address these concerns since 2005, and the country's outlook looks to be improving: In 2007 and 2008, key measures of economic, educational, and healthcare improvement were observed.</p><p id="""">Malawi has a low birth rate and a high infant death rate.

French Sudan (formerly known as the Sudanese Republic) merged with Senegal in 1959, becoming the Mali Federation in 1960.

The Dutch acquired ownership in 1598 and established a series of short-lived colonies over a 120-year span until abandoning their attempts in 1710. In 1715, France acquired sovereignty and renamed the island Isle de France. The island was taken by the United Kingdom in 1810, and four years later, France surrendered Mauritius and its dependencies to the United Kingdom in the Treaty of Paris (1814). Rodrigues, Agaléga, St. Brandon, Tromelin, the Chagos Archipelago, and, until 1906, the Seychelles were all part of the British colony of Mauritius. Because the Treaty of Paris did not directly name Tromelin, Mauritius and France disagree on its sovereignty. Until 1968, Mauritius was predominantly a plantation-based colony of the United Kingdom. Approximately two-thirds of the population (Indo-Mauritians) and slightly more than a quarter (Africans) are of Indian ancestry (Mauritian Creoles).</p><p id="""">Three years before Mauritius gained independence, the United Kingdom separated the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritian sovereignty, as well as the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches from the Seychelles, to establish the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).

The UK has limited access to the Chagos Archipelago, banning casual visitors, the media, and previous residents from entering. The sovereignty of the Chagos Islands is contested between Mauritius and the United Kingdom. The International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion in February 2019 directing the UK to restore the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as soon as possible in order to complete Mauritius' decolonization.</p><p id="""">Mauritius' population are ethnically, culturally, linguistically, and religiously varied due to its geographic position and centuries of colonization.

The United States borders it on the north; the Pacific Ocean on the south and west; Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea on the southeast; and the Gulf of Mexico on the east. Mexico is the world's 13th-largest nation by area, with 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 square miles); with around 126,014,024 residents, it is the 10th-most populated country and has the most Spanish-speakers. Mexico is structured as a federation of 31 states and its capital, Mexico City. With a population of almost 21 million people, the capital is not just a primate city, but also one of the world's biggest. Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León are other large cities.</p><p id="""">Pre-Columbian Mexico dates back to 8,000 BCE and is considered one of the world's six civilization cradles. The Mesoamerican area, in particular, was home to several interrelated civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. Last but not least were the Aztecs, who ruled the area in the century before European contact. The Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies defeated the Aztec Empire from Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521, creating the province of New Spain. From the colonial period forward, the image of Mexico's prehispanic indigenous civilizations has played a critical part in the construction of a unique Mexican identity, as embodied by the post-independence national flag with Aztec eagle. The Spanish state and the Catholic Church, both controlled by the Spanish crown, had crucial, interconnected institutional roles in extending colonial territory, imposing Christianity, and promoting the Spanish language over the three centuries after the conquest. Spanish power brought Mesoamerican indigenous peoples into colonial order, initially preserving indigenous social and economic institutions. Indigenous elites were acknowledged as nobles during Spanish control, and they functioned as liaisons between their communities and the Spanish governing apparatus. Northern Mexico was located outside of Mesoamerica; it was sparsely inhabited, and the indigenous peoples resisted invasion. Under Spanish dominion, the vast and diversified indigenous populations, known as ""Indians"" (indios), were at the bottom of the formal racial hierarchy, with the tiny number of white, European Spaniards (espaoles) at the top and the small community of mixed-race castas in the center. The discovery of vast silver resources beyond the zone of established indigenous people in Zacatecas and Guanajuato in the 1540s saw the Spanish Empire expand northward, with population increase as riches was extracted. Wealth from Asia and the New International streamed into Europe via the ports of Acapulco and Veracruz, contributing to Spain's role as a key world power for the following decades and causing a pricing revolution in Western Europe. The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the War of Independence against Spain, which began in 1810 as a result of Napoleon's invasion of Spain and was successfully concluded in 1821 by an alliance of mixed-race insurgents led by Vicente Guerrero and previously royalist creole elites led by Agustn de Iturbide.</p><p id="""">Political and economical instability characterized Mexico's early existence as an independent nation state. Liberal and conservative forces often altered the structure of administration, which alternated between brief monarchs and republics. During the nineteenth century, the nation was invaded by two foreign powers: first, following the Texas Revolution by American immigrants, which resulted in the Mexican–American War and massive territory losses to the United States after defeat in 1848. The Constitution of 1857 incorporated liberal reforms aimed at integrating indigenous people and limiting the role of the military and the Catholic Church. Conservatives responded with the Reform War, inviting France to invade and crown Maximilian Habsburg as Emperor against the Republican opposition headed by liberal President Benito Juárez. With the conclusion of the American Civil War and France's evacuation of its troops for the war with Prussia, the republicans supported by the United States reclaimed the nation and deposed the monarch. The dictatorship of military hero Porfirio Daz, who tried to modernize Mexico and restore order, dominated the later decades of the nineteenth century. The Porfiriato period (1876-1910) caused widespread social upheaval and culminated in the commencement of Mexico's decade-long civil war (Mexican Revolution). This struggle resulted in significant changes in Mexican culture, notably the adoption of the 1917 Constitution, which is still in force today.</p><p id="""">The surviving Revolutionary generals reigned as a series of presidents until the murder of Alvaro Obregón in 1928, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was formed the following year. The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years, beginning with a series of paternalistic developmental policies that yielded significant economic success, such as President Lázaro Cárdenas' socially-oriented nationalization attempts. Mexico also played an essential part in the United States' war effort during WWII, contributing to economic expansion. However, the PRI administration degraded over decades into a series of violent repressions (such as the Tlatelolco Massacre at the start of the 1968 Olympics), electoral frauds (such as the 1988 election), and a shift to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic strategy in the late twentieth century. The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 precipitated a significant indigenous insurrection in the state of Chiapas. In 2000, the PRI lost the presidency for the first time to the conservative party (PAN).</p><p id="""">Mexico is a poor nation, ranked 74th on the Human Development Index, yet it possesses the world's 15th-biggest nominal GDP and 11th-largest PPP economy, with the United States as its major economic partner. Mexico is a regional and intermediate power due to its vast economy and population, worldwide cultural impact, and gradual democratization; it is often characterized as a rising power but is regarded a recently industrialized state by numerous scholars. However, the nation continues to face socioeconomic inequality, poverty, and widespread criminality. It scores low on the Global Peace Index, owing to persistent warfare between the government and drug trafficking syndicates, who struggle fiercely for the US drug market and trade routes. Since 2006, this ""drug war"" has resulted in almost 120,000 fatalities.</p><p id="""">Mexico has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Americas and the seventh most in the world.

Austronesians were the first to create ocean-going sailing technology (particularly catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug boat construction, and the crab claw sail), allowing them to disperse quickly across the Indo-Pacific islands.

France borders it in the north, east, and west. The principality has 38,682 inhabitants, 9,486 of whom are Monégasque nationalities; it is commonly regarded as one of the most costly and wealthy locations in the world.

It is the world's most densely inhabited sovereign state, with a population density of 19,009 people per square kilometer (49,230 people per square mile). Monaco has a land boundary of 5.47 kilometers (3.40 miles) and the world's smallest coastline of around 3.83 kilometers (2.38 miles); its breadth fluctuates between 1,700 and 349 meters (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The state's highest point is a tiny trail called Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel in the Les Révoires ward, which is 161 meters (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is around 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the Italian border. Larvotto/Bas Moulins is its most populated ward, having a population of 5,443 in 2008.

The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, may be either a Monégasque or a French citizen; before making an appointment, the monarch confers with the Government of France. Key members of the Monaco judiciary are detached French judges. With occasional breaks, the House of Grimaldi has controlled Monaco since 1297. The Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 legally recognized the state's sovereignty, and Monaco became a full voting member of the United Nations in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and own foreign policy, France is responsible for its defense. Monaco does, however, retain two tiny military forces.</p><p id="""">The inauguration of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino, as well as a railway link to Paris, fueled economic expansion in the late nineteenth century. Since then, Monaco's moderate temperature, beauty, and gaming facilities have aided the principality's reputation as a tourist destination and wealthy entertainment center. Monaco has been a significant financial center in recent years, and it has attempted to diversify its economy towards the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting enterprises. Monaco is well-known as a tax haven, with no personal income tax and minimal company taxes. Over 30% of the population is a millionaire, and real estate prices in 2018 reached €100,000 ($116,374) per square meter.</p><p id="""">Monaco is not a formal member of the European Union (EU), although it does participate in several EU programs, such as customs and border controls. Monaco utilizes the euro as its only currency as a result of its ties with France; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was tied to and exchangeable with the French franc until January 1, 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the International Francophonie Organization (OIF). It also hosts the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of Formula One's original Grands Prix. The Monte Carlo Rally, held in the French Alps in January, is named after the local motorsports organization. AS Monaco, the principality's club football team, plays in the French Ligue 1 and has won the French championship many times.

Following a general election in 2010, the military junta was formally dissolved in 2011, and a nominally civilian administration was created. This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners, as well as successful elections in 2015, improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations, leading to the relaxation of trade and other economic sanctions, despite the fact that the country's treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in relation to the Rohingya conflict, was condemned by international organizations and many nations.</p><p id="""">The Burmese military (Tatmadaw) took control in a coup d'état after the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party gained a commanding majority in both chambers.

The diverse geography and steep mountain peaks of the nation, notably the Southern Alps, are mostly due to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. Wellington is New Zealand's capital city, while Auckland is its most populated city.</p><p id="""">New Zealand's islands were the last significant livable continent to be colonized by humans due to their remoteness. Polynesians started to settle on the islands between 1280 and 1350, developing a unique Mori culture. Abel Tasman, a Dutch adventurer, was the first European to glimpse and document New Zealand in 1642. In 1840, delegates from the United Kingdom and Mori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which established British control over the islands in its English translation. New Zealand became a colony of the British Empire in 1841, then a dominion in 1907; it obtained full formal independence in 1947, with the British queen remaining the head of state. Today, the bulk of New Zealand's 5.1 million people are of European heritage; the indigenous Mori are the biggest group, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. As a result, New Zealand's culture is mostly rooted from Mori and early British immigrants, with modern cultural expansion resulting from greater immigration. English, Mori, and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with the local version of English dominating.</p><p id="""">New Zealand, a developed country, rates well in worldwide assessments of national performance in areas such as quality of life, education, civil liberties protection, government openness, and economic independence. During the 1980s, New Zealand saw significant economic reforms that turned it from a protectionist to a liberalized free-trade economy. The national economy is dominated by the service sector, which is followed by the industrial sector and agriculture. International tourism is another important source of income. Nationally, legislative power is held by an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is held by the Cabinet, which is headed by the prime minister, presently Jacinda Ardern. The queen of the nation is Queen Elizabeth II, who is represented by the governor-general. In addition, for local government reasons, New Zealand is divided into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities. Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing nations in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, New Zealand's Antarctic territorial claim, are all included in the Realm of New Zealand.</p><p id="""">New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Community, and the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>",399,new-zealand,TRUE,TRUE

It has the westernmost point in continental Europe, and its Iberian section is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, and Spain to the north and east, the only nation having a land border with Portugal. Its two archipelagos are divided into two independent areas, each with its own regional administration. The capital and biggest city is Lisbon.</p><p id="""">Portugal is the Iberian Peninsula's and Europe's longest continuously existent nation-state, with its land constantly populated, conquered, and fought over since ancient times. It was inhabited by pre-Celtic and Celtic peoples, visited by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Ancient Greek merchants, and governed by the Romans, who were followed by Suebi and Visigothic Germanic invaders. Following the Moorish conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the majority of its area became part of Al-Andalus. Portugal was founded as a nation during the early Christian Reconquista. The County of Portugal, founded in 868, rose to prominence with the Battle of So Mamede (1128). Following the Battle of Ourique (1139), the Kingdom of Portugal was established, and independence from León was confirmed by the Treaty of Zamora (1143).</p><p id="""">Portugal developed the first worldwide maritime and commercial empire in the 15th and 16th centuries, becoming one of the world's leading economic, political, and military powers. During this time, known now as the Age of Discovery, Portuguese explorers pioneered marine exploration by discovering what would become Brazil (1500). During this period, Portugal monopolized the spice trade, divided the globe into four hemispheres with Castile, and extended the empire with military conquests in Asia. However, by the 18th century, events such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the country's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and Brazil's independence (1822) had resulted in a considerable decline in Portugal's previous affluence. This was followed by a civil war over royal succession between liberal constitutionalists and conservative absolutists that lasted from 1828 until 1834.</p><p id="""">The 1910 revolution ousted Portugal's several centuries-old monarchy, establishing the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic, which was ultimately replaced by the authoritarian Estado Novo administration. After the Carnation Revolution (1974), which ended the Portuguese Colonial War, democracy was restored. Almost all of its foreign possessions gained independence soon after. The surrender of Macau to China in 1999 marked the end of one of history's longest-running colonial empires.</p><p id="""">Portugal has left a strong cultural, architectural, and linguistic impact over the world, with around 250 million Portuguese speakers worldwide.

The arrival of African slaves and immigrants, particularly from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, drastically altered the island's cultural and demographic environment. Puerto Rico, in comparison to wealthy colonies like Peru and New Spain, had a minor yet vital position within the Spanish Empire.

The populace was organized first into clans, later into kingdoms. From the mid-eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Rwanda ruled, with Tutsi rulers defeating others militarily, consolidating control, and eventually instituting anti-Hutu policies. Rwanda was colonized by Germany in 1884 as part of German East Africa, and was later attacked by Belgium during World War I. Both European countries controlled via their monarchs and maintained a pro-Tutsi attitude. In 1959, the Hutu people rebelled. They slaughtered many Tutsis before establishing an autonomous, Hutu-dominated country commanded by President Grégoire Kayibanda in 1962. A military coup in 1973 deposed Kayibanda and installed Juvénal Habyarimana, who maintained the pro-Hutu policies. In 1990, the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front declared civil war. In April 1994, Habyarimana was murdered. Social tensions emerged during the Rwandan genocide, in which Hutu extremists slaughtered an estimated 500,000–1,000,000 Tutsi and Hutu in a hundred days. In July 1994, the RPF won a military victory that put an end to the genocide.</p><p id="""">Rwanda's burgeoning economy suffered greatly in the aftermath of the genocide in 1994, but has since recovered. The economy is mostly dependent on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea are the most important export revenue crops. Tourism is a rapidly expanding industry that is presently the country's top foreign currency earner. Rwanda has been recognized as a developing digital powerhouse for Africa in the twenty-first century, with a surge in start-up firms. Rwanda is one of just two nations where mountain gorillas may be visited securely, and gorilla tracking licenses are expensive. Rwandan culture is rich in music and dance, notably the highly choreographed intore dance.

It is the fifth-biggest nation in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia, with a land area of around 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi). It is bounded on the west by the Red Sea, on the north by Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait, on the east by the Persian Gulf, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, on the southeast by Oman, and on the south by Yemen. Bahrain is an island nation off the east coast of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are separated by the Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest. Saudi Arabia is the only nation having coastlines on both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and its landscape is mostly made up of dry desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Riyadh is the capital and biggest city. The nation is home to Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest cities.</p><p id="""">Pre-Islamic Arabia, the land that comprises modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the home of various ancient societies and civilizations; Saudi Arabia's prehistory has some of the world's oldest signs of human activity. Islam, the world's second-largest religion, arose in what is now Saudi Arabia. The Islamic prophet Muhammad unified the inhabitants of Arabia and established a single Islamic religious state in the early seventh century. Following his death in 632, his adherents swiftly extended Muslim dominion outside Arabia, seizing vast and unprecedented swaths of land in a couple of decades (from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to portions of Central and South Asia in the east). Arab dynasties from modern-day Saudi Arabia established the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, among many others throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p><p id="""">Historically, Saudi Arabia was divided into four separate historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and sections of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). King Abdulaziz established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. (known as Ibn Saud in the West). Through a series of victories that began in 1902 with the seizure of Riyadh, the ancestral seat of his family, the Al Saud, he unified the four areas into a single state. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been an absolute monarchy ruled by the king, the princes of the huge Al Saud royal family, and the country's traditional elites. Although the religious establishment's dominance has been considerably undermined in the 2010s, the ultraconservative Wahhabi theological movement within Sunni Islam has been characterized as a ""predominant characteristic of Saudi society."" Saudi Arabia maintains its Basic Law as a sovereign Arab Islamic state, with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital. Saudi Arabia is frequently referred to as ""the Land of the Two Holy Mosques"" in reference to the two holiest shrines in Islam, Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina).</p><p id="""">Petroleum was found on March 3, 1938, and was quickly followed by many further discoveries in the Eastern Province. Since then, Saudi Arabia has risen to become the world's second-biggest oil producer (after the United States) and largest oil exporter, with the world's second-largest oil reserves and sixth-largest gas reserves. The kingdom is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank, with a very high Human Development Index, and is the only Arab nation to be a member of the G20 major economies.</p><p id="""">The kingdom spends 8% of its GDP on defense (the most in the world after Oman), making it the world's third largest military spender behind the US and China, as well as the world's top weapons importer from 2015 to 2019, getting half of all US arms shipments to the Middle East. According to the BICC, Saudi Arabia is the world's 28th most militarized nation, with the region's second-best military equipment, behind Israel. By the late 2010s, there have been repeated requests to restrict military supplies to Saudi Arabia, owing primarily to suspected war crimes in Yemen and, more recently, the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The state has been chastised for a number of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism, and its poor human rights record, which has been characterized by the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment, failure to adopt adequate measures against human trafficking, state-sponsored discrimination against religious minorities and atheists, and antisemitism, as well as its strict interpretation of Sharia law.</p><p id="""">Saudi Arabia is regarded as a regional as well as a medium power. The Saudi economy is the biggest in the Middle East and the world's eighteenth largest. Saudi Arabia also boasts one of the world's youngest populations, with over half of its 34.2 million people under the age of 25. Saudi Arabia is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League, the Arab Air Carriers Organization, and OPEC.</p>",499,saudi-arabia,TRUE,TRUE

Sierra Leone is a secular country with a constitution that guarantees the separation of state and religion as well as religious freedom (which includes freedom of thoughts and religion).

(as the Crown needed to establish more dominion inland following the outcome of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885). As a result, the nation was renamed the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate, or simply British Sierra Leone.

A new constitution was enacted in 1971, clearing the way for Sierra Leone to become a republic and Siaka Stevens, head of the All People's Congress (APC), to become the country's first executive president. Stevens held this office for 14 years (until 1985) in a one-party government made possible by the contentious 1978 Constitution. However, Stevens' hand-picked successor, Joseph Saidu Momoh, vowed to restore the nation to a multi-party system; in 1991, a new constitution was established that gave the basis for a multi-party democracy. The same year, a horrific civil war broke out, lasting 11 years and destroying practically everything that distinguished Sierra Leone as a country. President Momoh was deposed in a coup headed by Sierra Leone Army commander Valentine Strasser barely a year after the conflict began (in 1992). Strasser was eventually ""outed"" by his army colleague and second-in-command Julius Maada Bio for failing to commit to a speedy transition to a civilian administration. Bio would then use a general election to revert the nation to a democratic republic in 1996.</p><p id="""">Despite the country's harsh civil conflict, the idea of a return to multi-party democracy sparked new hopes and enormous expectations among the majority of Sierra Leoneans in early 1996, as the national debate ""Peace before Elections versus Elections before Peace"" became a hot subject. The discussion was eventually won by ""Elections before Peace."" Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won the 1996 presidential election, becoming Sierra Leone's first multi-party democratically elected president. Since then, elections have ensured a seamless transfer to the office. Kabbah fled to Guinea after a short coup conducted by Sierra Leone Army Major Johnny Paul Koroma in 1997. He was reinstated after nine months thanks to ECOMOG's military involvement. Kabbah's presidency marked the beginning of a new Sierra Leone, with the civil war ending in 2002, a focus on fostering national unity and reconciliation, trust in government, peace and stability, improved relations with many countries, and the refounding of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces with special assistance and training led by the Government of the United Kingdom.</p><p id="""">Sierra Leone is home to around 18 ethnic groups, the two biggest and most powerful of which are the Temne and Mende peoples. Creole people, descendants of liberated African American and West Indian slaves, make up around 2% of the country's population. In schools and government administration, English is the official language. Krio is the most frequently spoken language in Sierra Leone, with 97 percent of the people speaking it. Sierra Leone is endowed with natural resources, including diamonds, gold, bauxite, and aluminum. The country is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Mano River Union, the Commonwealth of Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the African Development Bank, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

It is located approximately one degree north of the equator (137 kilometers or 85 miles) off the southern point of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Malacca Strait to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Johor Straits to the north. The territory of the nation is made up of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the total size of which has grown by 25% since the country's independence due to massive land reclamation efforts. It boasts the world's third greatest population density. Singapore has four official languages, English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil, in recognition of the need to protect the cultural identities of the nation's main ethnic groups. English is the language franca, and many public services are only accessible in English. Multiculturalism is written into the constitution and influences national policy in education, housing, and politics.</p><p id="""">Singapore has a millennium of history, beginning as a maritime port known as Temasek and later as a significant component element of multiple succeeding thalassocratic empires. Its modern history started in 1819, when Stamford Raffles founded Singapore as a British Empire entrepôt commercial station. The Southeast Asian colonies were reorganized in 1867, and Singapore became directly under British rule as part of the Straits Settlements. Singapore was controlled by Japan during WWII and reverted to the British administration as a distinct crown colony after Japan's defeat in 1945. Singapore obtained self-government in 1959 and joined the new Malaysian federation in 1963, together with Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of Lee Kuan Yew's egalitarian ""Malaysian Malaysia"" political ideology into Malaysia's other constituent entities – at the expense of the Bumiputera and Ketuanan Melayu policies – eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965.</p><p id="""">After experiencing early turbulence due to a lack of natural resources and a hinterland, the country quickly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalization, integrating itself into the world economy through free trade with minimal to no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialization, and a large accumulation of received foreign direct investment, foreign-exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. It is a developed nation that ranks joint-eleventh on the UN Human Development Index and has the world's second-highest GDP per capita (PPP). Singapore is the only nation in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies, making it a tax haven. It is a significant financial, marine shipping, and aviation center, and it is routinely recognized as one of the most expensive cities for expatriates and foreign employees to reside in. Singapore ranks well in important social variables such as education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with an 88 percent homeownership rate. Singaporeans have one of the world's highest life expectancy rates, quickest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption. The nation is one of four in the industrialized world with a death penalty retentionist position, along with Japan, the United States, and Taiwan. Non-governmental organizations are outraged by Singapore's use of the death penalty for drug trafficking.</p><p id="""">Singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary administration and a common law legal system. While elections are free, the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society, with limits on assembly, association, expression, and the press except for the Speakers' Corner; the PAP has ruled continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, with 83 out of 104 seats in Parliament as of the 2020 election, with the Workers' Party holding the remaining elected seats (WP). Singapore, one of ASEAN's five founding members, also serves as the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat, as well as hosting other international conferences and events.

Later, foreign Mediterranean peoples like the Phoenicians and ancient Greeks established coastal trade colonies, and the Carthaginians temporarily dominated a portion of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The Roman colonization of Hispania started in 218 BCE, and with the exception of the Atlantic coast, they swiftly dominated the region of modern-day Spain. By 206 BCE, the Romans had ousted the Carthaginians from the Iberian peninsula, dividing it into two administrative provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior.

Several Christian kingdoms arose in Northern Iberia, the most notable of which were León, Castile, Aragón, Portugal, and Navarre. Over the following seven decades, these kingdoms' sporadic southerly expansion—metahistorically characterized as a reconquest, or Reconquista—culminated in 1492 with the Christian seizing of the peninsula's last Muslim republic, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. That same year, Christopher Columbus set sail for the New World on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs, whose dynastic union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon is often seen as the emergence of Spain as a single nation. Jews and Muslims were compelled to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Castile and Aragon. The Inquisition was entrusted with ensuring religious orthodoxy among converts.

Following the collapse of Kush, the Nubians established the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia, the latter two of which lasted until roughly 1500. The majority of Sudan was progressively populated by Arab nomads throughout the 14th and 15th centuries.

Sudan's existing boundaries were established under the Egyptian administration, and the process of political, agricultural, and economic growth started. Nationalist feelings in Egypt sparked the Orabi Revolt in 1881, ""weakening"" the Egyptian monarchy and ultimately culminating to the United Kingdom's annexation of Egypt. Simultaneously, religious-nationalist fervor rose in Sudan, culminating in the Mahdist Uprising headed by the self-proclaimed Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad and the formation of the Caliphate of Omdurman. The Mahdist troops were finally destroyed by a combination Egyptian-British military forces, restoring the Egyptian monarch's power. Egyptian sovereignty in Sudan, however, would now be just nominal, since the actual authority in both Egypt and Sudan was now the United Kingdom. Under British coercion, Egypt agreed to share sovereignty over Sudan as a condominium with the United Kingdom in 1899. Sudan was effectively administered as a British colony. The twentieth century witnessed the rise of Egyptian and Sudanese nationalism aimed at removing the British presence. The Egyptian revolution of 1952 overthrew the monarchy and demanded that British soldiers evacuate from Egypt and Sudan. Muhammad Naguib, one of the revolution's two co-leaders and Egypt's first President, who was half-Sudanese and reared in Sudan, made Sudanese independence a priority of the revolutionary administration. Under Egyptian and Sudanese pressure, the United Kingdom agreed to Egypt's proposal that both nations discontinue their joint authority over Sudan and give Sudan independence the next year. Sudan was proclaimed an independent state on January 1, 1956.</p><p id="""">Following Sudan's independence, the Jaafar Nimeiry administration established Islamist governance. This widened the schism between the Islamic North, which serves as the seat of administration, and the Animists and Christians of the South. Differences in language, religion, and political power erupted into a civil war between government troops supported by the National Islamic Front (NIF) and southern rebels whose most significant unit was the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), resulting in South Sudan's independence in 2011. Between 1989 and 2019, Sudan was ruled by a 30-year-long military dictatorship led by Omar al-Bashir, who was accused of human rights violations such as torture, persecution of minorities, sponsorship of global terrorism, and ethnic genocide as a result of its actions in the Darfur region, which erupted in 2003. The regime's acts murdered between 300,000 and 400,000 individuals. Protests demanding Bashir's resignation erupted in 2018, resulting in a coup on 11 April 2019 and Bashir's incarceration.</p><p id="""">Sudan's national religion was Islam, and Islamic laws were in effect from 1983 until 2020 when the country became a secular state.

Stockholm is the capital and biggest city.

Because of the substantial ocean impact, the climate is often moderate for its northern latitude. Despite its latitude, Sweden gets mild continental summers due to its location between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and massive Russia.

The south of Sweden is mostly agricultural, but the north is heavily wooded and home to a section of the Scandinavian Mountains.</p><p id="""">Since prehistoric times, Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden, coming into history as the Geats (Swedish: Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and forming the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. During the early 12th century, Sweden became an independent state. After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century destroyed nearly a third of the Scandinavian population, the Hanseatic League's supremacy in Northern Europe posed an economic and political danger to Scandinavia. This resulted in the formation of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, from which Sweden withdrew in 1523. When Sweden joined the Protestant side in the Thirty Years' War, an expansion of its borders started, and the Swedish Empire was founded. Until the early 18th century, this was one of Europe's major powers. Swedish lands beyond the Scandinavian Peninsula were progressively lost over the 18th and 19th centuries, culminating in Russia's acquisition of modern-day Finland in 1809. Sweden was last actively engaged in a war in 1814 when Norway was forcibly forced into a personal union, which was amicably dissolved in 1905. Sweden has remained at peace since then, with an official policy of neutrality in international affairs. Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace in 2014, surpassing even Switzerland's peace record.

Large-scale Han Chinese immigration to western Taiwan started in the 17th century as a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning.

Following Japan's surrender in 1945, the Republic of China, which had ousted the Qing in 1911, acquired control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies. The restart of the Chinese Civil War ended in the ROC's fall of mainland China to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) troops in 1949 and retreat to Taiwan.

It has a high ranking in terms of political and civil freedoms, education, health care, and human development.</p><p id="""">Taiwan's political status is debatable. After UN members agreed in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead of the ROC, the ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations. The ROC maintained its claim to be the only legal representation of China and its territory, however, this has been minimized since the country's democracy in the 1990s. The PRC claims Taiwan and rejects diplomatic ties with nations that recognize the ROC. Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with 13 of the United Nations' 193 member nations and the Holy See, while many more maintain unofficial diplomatic links via representative offices and organizations that operate as de facto embassies and consulates. Taiwan is denied participation in international organizations in which the PRC participates, or it is allowed to join solely on a non-state basis under different names. Domestically, the major political conflict is between parties advocating for eventual Chinese unification and promoting a pan-Chinese identity and those advocating for formal international recognition and promoting a Taiwanese identity; as the twenty-first century has progressed, both sides have moderated their positions in order to broaden their appeal.</p>",399,taiwan,TRUE,TRUE

Siam allied with the Allies in World War I, a political choice intended to repair the unequal treaties.

A military revolution led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat in the late 1950s resurrected the monarchy's traditionally significant role in politics.

Following Alexander the Great's conquests, which began the Hellenistic period, most of current Turkey's ancient territories were culturally Hellenised, which lasted until the Byzantine era. The Sultanate of Rum controlled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it collapsed into minor Turkish states. The Ottomans consolidated the princes and conquered the Balkans beginning in the late 13th century, while Turkification of Anatolia expanded throughout the Ottoman era. Ottoman expansion resumed under Selim I after Mehmed II seized Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453. During Suleiman the Magnificent's reign, the Ottoman Empire rose to worldwide prominence. The empire's strength began to dwindle in the late 18th century, with a steady loss of lands. In the early nineteenth century, Mahmud II initiated an era of modernization. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 limited the Sultan's power and, after a 30-year hiatus, established the Ottoman Parliament, bringing the empire into a multi-party era. The Three Pashas took control of the nation after the 1913 coup, which permitted the Empire's entrance into World War I as part of the Central Powers in 1914. The Ottoman government perpetrated genocide against its Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian citizens throughout the conflict. The Ottoman Empire was partitioned after its loss in the war.</p><p id="""">The destruction of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which succeeded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923, and the declaration of the Republic on 29 October 1923 resulted from the Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers. Turkey became a secular, unitary, and parliamentary republic as a result of reforms launched by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey was a crucial player in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952. Several military coups occurred in the nation in the later part of the twentieth century.

Tuvalu is made up of three coral reef islands and six atolls. They are located between latitudes of 5° and 10° south and longitudes of 176° and 180°.

Tuvalu's islands have a total land area of 26 square kilometers (10 sq mi).</p><p id="""">According to well-established views, the initial residents of Tuvalu were Polynesians who migrated into the Pacific some three thousand years ago. Polynesians routinely traveled by canoe across the Pacific islands long before European contact. Polynesian navigation abilities allowed them to arrange sophisticated voyages in double-hulled sailing canoes or outrigger canoes. Polynesians, according to scholars, moved out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls, which subsequently acted as a stepping stone for further migration into Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia.</p><p id="""">During an attempt to find Terra Australis, Spanish sailor lvaro de Mendaa became the first European to sail through the archipelago in 1568, seeing the island of Nui.

In the late nineteenth century, the United Kingdom claimed possession of the Ellice Islands, claiming them as part of their area of influence. Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa proclaimed each of the Ellice Islands a British protectorate between October 9 and 16, 1892. As part of the British Western Pacific Territories, Britain appointed a resident commissioner to manage the Ellice Islands (BWPT).

This short-lived state was forcefully recreated as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which joined the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1922. Millions of Ukrainians were slain during the Holodomor, which lasted from 1932 to 1937. The Soviet Union took Western Ukraine from Poland in 1939, four weeks after Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Treaty and one day after the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet ratified the pact. Ukraine was the most populated and industrialized republic after the Russian SFSR from 1922 and 1991.</p><p id="""">With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its freedom. Ukraine has been administered as a unitary republic with a semi-presidential government since its independence. It proclaimed itself a neutral state in 1994, forging a limited military collaboration with Russia and other CIS nations as well as a relationship with NATO. Mass protests and rallies known as the Euromaidan erupted in 2013, developing into the Revolution of Dignity, which resulted in the formation of a new government. These events triggered Russia's annexation of Crimea and a conflict in Donbas against Russian-backed rebels, culminating in a Russian invasion in February 2022. Despite the continuing conflict with Russia, Ukraine has continued to pursue deeper economic, political, and military connections with the West (especially NATO).</p><p id="""">According to several international observers, Ukraine is one of the poorest nations in Europe and suffers from extensive corruption.

Venezuela experienced political turbulence and despotism throughout the nineteenth century, and was governed by regional military dictators until the mid-twentieth century. Since 1958, the nation has enjoyed a succession of democratic administrations, with the exception of the majority of the area being controlled by military dictatorships, and the time has been marked by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s triggered significant political crises and widespread social unrest, including the fatal Caracazo riots in 1989, two failed coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President on allegations of misuse of public money in 1993. The 1998 Venezuelan presidential election served as the trigger for the Bolivarian Revolution, which started with a 1999 Constituent Assembly in which a new Venezuelan Constitution was enforced. Soaring oil prices aided the government's populist social welfare measures, temporarily raising social expenditure and lowering economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the dictatorship. Poverty, on the other hand, started to rise in the 2010s.

The incumbent government's excesses and bad policies led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The nation is dealing with record hyperinflation, food shortages, unemployment, poverty, sickness, high child mortality, malnutrition, terrible crime, and corruption. These reasons have contributed to the Venezuelan migration crisis, in which over three million people have left the nation.

The United Nations General Assembly passed its first resolution on Western Sahara in 1965, requesting that Spain decolonize the area. One year later, the General Assembly voted a second resolution demanding that Spain hold a referendum on self-determination. Spain handed up administrative authority of the area to a combined administration of Morocco (which had technically claimed the territory since 1957) and Mauritania in 1975. A conflict broke out between those nations and the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi nationalist organization that declared the SADR and established an exile government in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania renounced its claims in 1979, and Morocco finally gained de facto control of the vast majority of the area, including all major towns and the vast majority of natural resources.

South Yemen was a British protectorate known as the Aden Protectorate until 1967, when it gained independence and eventually became a Marxist-Leninist state. In 1990, the two Yemeni republics merged to establish the present Republic of Yemen (al-Jumhryah al-Yamanyah). President Ali Abdullah Saleh served as the nascent republic's first president until his resignation in 2012, after the Arab Spring.</p><p id="""">Yemen has been in a political crisis since 2011, beginning with public demonstrations over poverty, unemployment, and corruption, as well as President Saleh's proposal to rewrite Yemen's constitution and erase the presidential term limit. President Saleh resigned, and the presidency was handed over to Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. Since then, Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war (along with a Saudi-led military intervention aimed at restoring Hadi's government), with several proto-state entities claiming to govern the country: the Cabinet of Yemen/Presidential Leadership Council, the Supreme Political Council, and the Southern Transitional Council. Since January 2016, at least 56,000 civilians and combatants have been murdered in Yemen as a result of armed conflict. The conflict has caused a famine that has affected 17 million people. The lack of clean drinking water, caused by depleted aquifers and the devastation of the country's water infrastructure, has also resulted in the greatest and fastest-spreading cholera epidemic in modern history, with 994,751 probable cases. Since the epidemic started spreading fast at the end of April 2017, over 2,226 individuals have perished. The continuous humanitarian crisis and fighting have drawn global condemnation for having a severe increasing impact on Yemen's humanitarian condition, which some claim has reached the level of a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" and others have even labeled it genocide. It has exacerbated the country's already precarious human rights status.</p><p id="""">Yemen is an Arab League, United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, and Organization of Islamic Cooperation member. It is classified as a least developed nation due to its multiple ""severe structural barriers to sustainable development."" According to the United Nations, Yemen has the most people in need of humanitarian help, with around 24 million people, or 85 percent of its population, in need. As of 2020, the nation ranks first in the Fragile State Index, second in the Global Hunger Index (surpassed only by the Central African Republic), and has the lowest Human Development Index of any non-African country.</p>",499,yemen,TRUE,TRUE

From 1964 through 1991, Kaunda's socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP) ruled. Kaunda was a prominent figure in regional diplomacy, working closely with the US to find solutions to problems in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia. From 1972 until 1991, Zambia was a one-party state, with UNIP being the only legal political party operating under Kaunda's slogan ""One Zambia, One Nation."" In 1991, Kaunda was replaced by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, ushering in an era of socioeconomic progress and political decentralisation.

The Gokomere, the Bantu people who would become the ethnic Shona, created the massive city-state of Great Zimbabwe during its late iron age. Great Zimbabwe thrived financially and culturally during the 14th to 15th century, becoming a commercial powerhouse controlling the gold, ivory, and copper trades with the Swahili coast and numerous Arab and Indian nations. The great Kingdom of Zimbabwe was created from there, followed by the Rozvi and Mutapa empires.

The state faced international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla struggle with black nationalist movements, culminating in a peace deal in April 1980 that created universal suffrage and de jure statehood as Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe thereafter joined the Commonwealth of Nations, from which it was suspended in 2002 for violations of international law committed by the then-government of Robert Mugabe, and from which it resigned in December 2003.</p><p id="""">Robert Mugabe became Zimbabwe's Prime Minister in 1980, when his ZANU–PF party won elections after the end of white minority rule; he served as President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his retirement in 2017.

The economy endured collapse and hyperinflation from 2000 to 2009 before regaining once the use of currencies other than the Zimbabwean dollar was authorized, however recovery has subsequently slowed. After more than a year of demonstrations against his regime and Zimbabwe's rapidly failing economy, Mugabe was put under house arrest by the country's national army in a coup d'état on November 15, 2017, and resigned six days later.
